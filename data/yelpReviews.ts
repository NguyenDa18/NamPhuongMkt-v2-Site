Well stocked with a surprisingly wide variety and origin of products, very affordable. Will be making this a regular grocery stop!'

It\'s well priced and actually has a wonderful variety and I have been shopping here for my regular Asian ingredient needs instead of going to Hong Phat or Fubonn anymore. I really love that this store exists in my neighborhood and would recommend it to anyone that wants to support a local spot that will fulfill your Asian grocery shopping needs.'

		'text': 'I\'m glad that other people recommended this place, so that I could find it and try it. The prices are GREAT, and the staff was super-friendly and helpful. Fat bunches of Thai Basil and cilantro at great prices. I usually refuse to buy meat at tiny grocery stores, because I\'m afraid that it won\'t be fresh. But the ground pork looked so fresh that I bought it (only $2.99 lb) and it WAS super fresh. Great prices on fish sauce and other basics. Best of all? I had driven past Hong Phat where the parking lot was SO FULL, and in the age of Covid I didn\'t want to go anywhere crowded. Here at Nam Phuong, the woman working here had her mask on the whole time, and there was only one other customer in the store! No crowds, great prices, lovely staff, great experience! I\'ll keep coming back.'

		'text': 'Small but well stocked Asian Grocery store with surprising large variety of brands across a multitude of categories! Noodles, condiments, sauces, coconut milk, candies, hot sauce - so many brands and various size portions.\nWas in my way to my favorite Asian grocery store, Hong Phat Food Center, to buy Chinese cabbage, chili paste and coconut milk when I noticed this market which I\'ve probably passed hundreds of times! It\'s across the street from Safeway on NE Sandy.\nThere are various sized cooking vessels, bowls, woks and tea pots in the front of the store. The rest are grocery items including fresh meat and veggies in the back. Since I\'m making wontons, I picked up ground pork which was only $2.49 a pound, half the price of an American grocery store. Cabbage, onions and scallions were also half price.\nThe owner was super friendly. Store was clean, aisles well stocked and organized. Loved walking up and down every section marveling over items that are so foreign to my palette. I found the green Chinese slim tea I sometimes drink when I\'m having digestive issues. It was half the price I pay on Amazon.\nWhenever I need to pick up Asian condiments or pack of mung bean noodles for meal prep, this will be my go-to place. I will go to Hung Phat when I\'m stocking up or need prepared food ps and bakery items.'

The best part is the husband, who\'s incredibly friendly and helpful.  It\'s an enjoyable experience shopping here and if I have a little time to chat I always learn something too.'
